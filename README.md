ntroduction

Many organizations operate multiple AWS accounts but struggle with implementing security, compliance, and governance best practices across their environments. This project focuses on consolidating multiple AWS accounts under AWS Control Tower, ensuring compliance with GDPR and HIPAA while implementing strong security controls using AWS native security services.

Architecture Overview

AWS Control Tower – Governs multi-account AWS environments.

AWS Security Hub – Monitors security risks and compliance gaps.

AWS GuardDuty – Detects anomalies and potential threats.

AWS IAM with ABAC & RBAC – Implements least-privilege access controls.

AWS WAF and ALB/NLB – Secures application access with encryption.

STAR Methodology Implementation

Situation:

A healthcare provider operates multiple AWS accounts without a unified security framework, exposing them to potential GDPR and HIPAA violations.

Task:

Implement a security-compliant AWS multi-account environment, enforcing best practices with AWS Control Tower while applying robust security measures across all AWS resources.

Action:

Set Up AWS Control Tower to Govern Multiple AWS Accounts:

Deploy AWS Control Tower to enforce standard security policies across all accounts.

Enable AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty:

aws securityhub enable-security-hub
aws guardduty create-detector

Security Hub provides continuous compliance monitoring.

GuardDuty detects suspicious activities.

Implement IAM ABAC & RBAC for Least Privilege Access:

Define AWS Identity and Access Management policies enforcing fine-grained access control.

      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::health-data-bucket",
         "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"aws:PrincipalTag/job": "DataScientist"}}
      }
   ]
}

Implement Secure Networking with WAF and TLS Encryption:

Deploy WAF rules to protect against SQL injection and DDoS attacks.

Enforce TLS 1.2 and 1.3 on ALB and NLB for secure traffic.

aws wafv2 create-web-acl --name secure-waf --scope REGIONAL --region us-east-1

Ensure Encryption for Data in Transit and at Rest:

Enable HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3) for secure ALB communication.

Apply S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3) for GDPR compliance.

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket secure-health-bucket --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]}'

Result:

Achievement: Successfully implemented a secure, compliant AWS multi-account environment.

Use Case: Healthcare, finance, and government organizations ensuring GDPR and HIPAA compliance.
